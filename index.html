        Visual Studio is the best platform for begginers who don't understand much coding but you will have to know
        about the basic commands to work on Visual Studio. Concentrate on the Syntax and the Spacing, Allignment etc.
        Well talking about the concat() function it is really the best and those who don,t know about it I shall tell
        them that it is used to join two variables, tags etc. Do you know the best thing about this platform is the ease
        of accesing the files, extensions and performance. Best for students who want to learn about Webpages. I
        reccomend Visual Studio platform for the students.
